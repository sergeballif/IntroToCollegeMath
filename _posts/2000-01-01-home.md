# Intro To College Math 

This page is home to the course material for the course Introduction to College Mathematics. The course covers three main topics:

* Consumer Mathematics
* Probability and Statistics
* Algebra and Modeling

For each topic there are three components:
1. a preview activity (to be completed before class), 
2. a homework activity (which includes the in-class lecture screens), and 
3. an in-class practice activity (completed by individuals, but in pairs).
